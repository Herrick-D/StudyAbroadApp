This was my senior project for my Computer Science degree. The purpose of this app is to make planning a trip abroad easier through its four main features: Packing List, Places to Visit, Budget Tracker, and Document Vault.

1) Packing List: This feature will allow users to create packing lists. Each list will be started by selecting a number of trip-specific attributes before allowing a user to enter items they plan to pack. Users also have the option of searching for packing lists that have been shared by other users and selecting items from those lists in order to make their own packing lists easier to create.

2) Places to Visit: This feature will allow users to search for places to visit based on where they will be going. This is an entirely user-driven feature, meaning users will be able to input new places to visit if one does not exist, rank places, and add comments to places.

3) Budget Tracker: This feature is for the budget-oriented traveler. This feature will allow users to keep track of the amount of money they are spending on a trip, so that they are not overspending.

4) Document Vault: This feature is a way to keep travel documents in a secure, offline environment in the event a user loses their travel documents, and does not have access to an internet connection. Having backups of documents can expedite the process of recovery at an embassy if the originals have been lost or stolen.
